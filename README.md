# Seaborn Matplotlib Data Visualization

Jupyter Notebook data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

- Visualizes stock prices using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 3 Stocks are considered including Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).
- Using the stock_daily_prices.csv and stocks_daily_returns.csv dataset included in the course/workshop package, please do the following:
    - Import both datasets using Pandas.
    - Using Matplotlib, plot lineplots that display all 3 stocks daily prices on one single figure.
    - Using Matplotlib, plot 3 stocks daily prices on multiple subplots.
    - Using Matplotlib, plot the 3 plots on subplots next to each other (all figures in one row).
    - Using Matplotlib, plot the scatterplot between Facebook and Twitter daily returns.
    - Using Seaborn, plot similar scatterplot between Facebook and Twitter daily returns.
    - Assume that you now expanded your portfolio to include additional stocks such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG). You decided to become bullish on Twitter and you allocated 60% of your assets in it. You also decided to equally divide the rest of your assets in other stocks (AMZN, FB, GOOG, NFLX). Using Matplotlib, plot a pie chart that shows these allocations. Use 'explodeâ€™ attribute to increase the separation between TWTR and the rest of the portfolio.
    - Using Matplotlib, plot the histogram for FB returns using 40 bins with red color. Display the mean and Standard deviation on top of the figure.
    - Using Seaborn, plot a heatmap that shows the correlations between stocks daily returns.
    - Plot a 3D plot showing all daily returns from FB, TWTR and NFLX [External Research is required].
